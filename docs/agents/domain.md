# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists - it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area about to be changed. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/adr/
`-- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept is absent from the glossary, either reconsider the new language or note the real gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
